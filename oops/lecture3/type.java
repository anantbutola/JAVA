/*
 * Single Inheritance: Have one base class and one derived class . Derived class inherits members of Base class.
 * Eg:  class(BoxWeight) inherits members of class(Box). 
 

 * Multilevel Inheritaance : D1-derived class inherits members of B-base class and D2-deriived class
 *                          inherits members of D1 class.
 * Means for  D2 class its base class is D1.
 * Eg: class(BoxWeight) inherits members of class(Box). and class(BoxPrice) inherits members of class(BoxWeight).

 * Multiple Inheritance :we have derived class D1 and have two or more parent(B1,B2,B3,....) class of D1.
 * Eg: we have Base-class (B1) having n=10 and other BAse class (B2) having n=15,Both base class having one derived class D.
 * if we create object(obj) of D and acccess "n" then (obj.n)=? , this creates ambiguity means two possible solution for "n".
 * Therefore,JAVA doesn't support "MULTIPLE_INHERITANCE".
 * "MULTIPLE_INHERITANCE" supported by "interfaces".  

 *Hierarchial Inheritance :Having one Baseclass-B and multiple derived classes which inherits members of B.
 *Eg: Having Baseclass Box and derivedclasses BoxWeight and BoxPrice

*Hybrid Inheritance: JAVA not fully support hybrid inhertance b/c of multiple inheritance .
*It is combination of two or more types of inheritance.
Eg: baseclass B1  have derived class d1 and d2 and further d1 class have its derived class d3.
  this eg is valid b/c of no multiple inheritance

  Eg: baseclass b1 have two derived classes d1 and d2 and both d1 and d2 have single derived class d3 .
  this eg is not valid b/c of multiple inheritance in here.
 

* Self inheritance or cyclic inheritance- is not possible means (class B inherits class B) is not possible.
