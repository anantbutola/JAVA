What Is File Handling in Java?

File Handling in Java means reading from and writing to files stored on your computer’s disk — using Java’s I/O (Input/Output) streams.
It allows your program to store data permanently, instead of keeping it only in memory (RAM).

🧩 Types of File Streams in Java

In Java, all input and output operations are done through streams.
A stream is simply a flow of data — like water flowing through a pipe 💧

Data can enter your program (input stream) or leave your program (output stream).

| Type                      | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1️⃣ Byte Streams**      | Used for handling **binary data** (images, audio, video, PDFs, etc.) |
| **2️⃣ Character Streams** | Used for handling **text data** (letters, characters, strings, etc.) |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1️⃣ Byte Streams
-->Work with raw bytes (8-bit data).
-->Suitable for non-text files like images, music, videos, and executable files.
-->Classes are derived from:
- InputStream (for input)
- OutputStream (for output)

2️⃣ Character Streams
-->Work with 16-bit Unicode characters (text).
-->Suitable for text files like .txt, .csv, or .java.
-->Classes are derived from:
- Reader (for input)
- Writer (for output)
